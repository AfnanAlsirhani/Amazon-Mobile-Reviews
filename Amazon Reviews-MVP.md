## Amazon Reviews-MVP

Introduction
============

In this project, we collected people textual reviews about different purchased products from Amazon. the data set contains approximately 413,000 customer reviews including products prices, final customer ratings and the products' names.

Approach
========

We are going to follow the steps below in order to systematically answer the research questions posed in `Research Question(s)` section above.

- We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and techiques to preprocess the textual data and convert them into suitable numerical formats compatible with different machine learning algorithms.

- We will use the processed data to computationally calculate the sentiment of the customer to a product.

- We will use the processed data to calculate the similarity between customers' reviews and predict sentiments for future reviews using classification models.

- We will apply PCA-SVD techniques in order to reduce the dimensions of the data and improve the prediction through utilizing the latent dimensions discovered by those methods.
- Moreover, we will apply Non negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Linear Semantic Analysis (LSA) on smaller data set to diagnose any problems. Afterwards, we will implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LSA) on the whole data set.
- We will perform Topic Modeling on negative and positive sentiments separately.
